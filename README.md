# tiny prover

This is a tiny theorem prover that will determine the satisfiability or validity of a given first order logic formula. It's based on Tableaux method with a lot of implementation details designed by me.

I'll soon provide a user manual and the limitations of this prover, but as of right now it's basically able to deal with any first order logic formula that doesn't contain free variables.
